Flash games ignited my love for technology; my favorite childhood online games were text-based adventure games . My passion for these games made me want to learn how to create online games and understand the technology that made my favorite games run. Therefore, majoring in computer science felt appropriate for me. 

Years passed, and I was in my last year of college, but I realized I was unsure of a career path within computer science that interested me. I still enjoyed playing online games, but I wanted to become something other than a developer or a software engineer. My interest in data increased when I took a Data Analysis in Python course. I wanted to utilize data to predict potential outcomes so there would be a deeper understanding of the actions companies can take.
