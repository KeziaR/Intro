<p> Flash games ignited my love for technology; my favorite childhood online games were text-based adventure games. My passion for these games made me want to learn how to create online games and understand the technology that made my favorite games run. Therefore, majoring in computer science felt appropriate for me. As a result, I have dedicated my time to strengthening my knowledge of different software and tools within the technology field, so I continually develop my technical expertise. </p>
